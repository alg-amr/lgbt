    "description": "As the world’s second largest country in sheer size, Canada’s unique majesty is something that smaller countries cannot touch. Your Canada vacation can be custom designed to make sure that you get the experience you expect – from quiet mountain retreats to exciting outdoor adventure to 24-hour nonstop city life, the beauty of Canada will embrace your heart, with a French accent on love! Canada is a land of endless sky and a vast frontier, disturbed only by the steep rise of alpine slopes and cozy mountain hotels. In Canada, polar bears frolic on vast glaciers and grizzly bears wade in clear streams. White water rafting is a thrill for many visitors, while others enjoy the laid-back harmony of a scenic drive along the craggy shores of the Atlantic Canada provinces. Canada is known for its natural habitats, and not just ones for the moose, whales and caribou. In places like Banff, humans enjoy getting back to basics by exploring the open country, cowboy-style on horseback, sometimes spotting herds of buffalo. Other flocks of people enjoy nesting in cosmopolitan cities like the French-influenced Montreal and Quebec City, the British-influenced Victoria and international cities like Calgary, Ottawa, Vancouver and Toronto. Whether you enjoy hitting the trails, hitting the links, or hitting the town, you’ll definitely be in your element when you hit the road to Canada.",

                  "Galley Bay is an all-inclusive beachfront hideaway created for  discerning travelers in search of a refined, yet unpretentious  escape. It enjoys a secluded setting amidst forty-acres of lush,  tropical gardens between a bird sanctuary lagoon and a 3/4 mile  beach on the undeveloped west coast of Antigua. Great care has  been taken to ensure the resort not only compliments, but also  takes full advantage of these untouched natural surroundings.  Thatch, bamboo, and terracotta combine to establish an ambiance of elegant rusticity in the alfresco public areas, whilst a  picturesque wooden deck ensures maximum exposure to the ocean views. There is little disruption from the outside world as  access to the resort is via a wooden bridge traversing the bird  sanctuary. The 98 guestrooms are discreetly tucked away amidst  the palms, more than three-quarters of them lying directly on  the white sand beach and boasting breathtaking views of the  Caribbean Sea- the comfortable Superior and Deluxe Rooms all  feature private terraces or balconies. The Premium Suites are distinguished by sunken living rooms, floor-to-ceiling windows and expansive bathrooms with deep-soaking tubs, and updated  amenities such as complimentary internet access, a DVD player  and an iPod docking station. Home-away-from-home comforts throughout include air conditioning, ceiling fans, satellite TVs, mini-refrigerators (stocked on the day arrival only) and coffee makers. Set just behind close to the bird sanctuary is the unique Gauguin cottages with their own individual splash pools. Designed as semi-private sanctuaries for couples, each one consists of two thatched-roof rondovals (one a bedroom and the other a bathroom/dressing room), as well as splash pools with paved sundecks, many of them overlooking the lagoon. Woven bamboo ceilings, uneven whitewashed walls and cool  terracotta tiling establish their charming Caribbean theme, whilst the beach is no more than fifty-yards away.",
                  "In keeping with Galley Bay's tranquil, escapist ambience,  recreational activities tend to be of a relaxing nature and  guests are generally quite content to sunbathe on the sands  or around the landscaped swimming pool. Those in the mood  for a little action, however, can take advantage of the  tennis court, air-conditioned fitness room or non-motorized watersports, such as windsurfing, sailing, snorkeling and kayaking. Massages are also available on-site, scuba-diving can be arranged nearby, whilst golf on two 18-hole golf  courses are less than 30-minutes drive away. Dining is also  an important part of any stay at Galley Bay, the European  Executive Chef specializing in Euro-Caribbean cuisine that  makes the most of fresh local produce and seafood. Guests  seeking a change from the a la carte fine dining experience  of The Sea Grape can enjoy the grilled fare of the more  intimate Gauguin restaurant, both dining venues alfresco and just steps from the Caribbean Sea. Or guests can also experience fine dining at Ismay's restaurant (an additional surcharge applies for this dining option). Afternoon tea, evening hors d'oeuvres, live entertainment, cocktail parties and Caribbean barbecues all contribute to the hotels sociable, tropical ambiance, whilst the personal service from the staff contributes to its exceptionally high repeat-guest quota."

Aruba takes pride in its diversity, from its residents to its visitors, and its list of things to do is a clear reflection of that. Gay, straight, and everyone in between gather at upscale, lesbian-owned Karma Lounge dance club after midnight, and popular, trendy gay bar Jimmy’s Place is legendary. An expansive outdoor patio where a DJ spins every Thursday add to the casual party atmosphere, and liven up the carefree nights that complement an average of 364 sunny days a year.  Those well-lit hours are well-spent with toes dug in the sands of Palm Beach or Eagle Beach, the widest stretch on the island and nesting grounds for four types of adorable sea turtles. Seasonally, watch hatchlings scuttle into the sea for a truly touching experience, or get into the water yourself any time of the year—there are infinite water sports to choose from. Land activities also run the gamut, with Arikok National Park stealing the spotlight with 20% of the island’s acreage and trails to criss-cross it all.",

Do both in Hamilton, its capital city, where an upscale Front, Queen, and Reid Streets also provides opportunities to buy real Bermuda shorts, or near King’s Wharf, the well-known cruise port and home of The Keep, the National Museum of Bermuda, and the friendly inhabitants of Dolphin Quest Bermuda.

Continue the nautical theme but add a modern slant to it with a stop in UNESCO World Heritage Site St. George to ogle the yachts in that harbor.   The beauty in Bermuda isn’t just in its towns, music, golf courses, and beaches. Its public consciousness is evolving to match.

Same-sex marriage has been recognized in the “B” of the ABC Islands since 2011, and a lack of stratification between its straight and LGBT families creates an environment of peaceful harmony that’s perfectly in line with a relaxing, low-key tropical getaway…which is exactly what you’ll get when you choose this destination.  In this diver’s paradise, going out for the evening doesn’t mean donning heels or a collared shirt; rather, date night attire is more normally flippers, a wetsuit, and full tank of oxygen. Since 1979, the 2,700 hectares of reefs, seagrass beds, and mangrove forests surrounding the island have been a designated National Marine Park, cementing its reputation as one of the best dive spots in the entire world. In fact, this island was chosen as the location for the second annual Diving for Life Scuba Jamboree back in 1993, an important charity that supports LGBT community members stricken with AIDS. During the day, you can support this sleepy island’s local artisans and musicians at the Cultural Market on the last Saturday of each month, or get to know its reptilian, winged, and four-legged residents at Washington-Slagbaai National Park. Both will welcome you warmly.",

        "description": "Within its 36 square miles lie only a privileged few rooms, an exclusivity that lends itself to its slogan, “Nevis…Naturally.” Here, you’ll find no oversized cruise ships, no casinos, no crowds, and no unwanted distractions that will take you away from appreciating the natural serenity of an island well suited to upscale travelers. It was for this peaceful seclusion that Princess Diana came for in 1992, joining some of her most affluent countrymen in what is one of their top Caribbean picks. In fact, 80% of this destination’s guests are British, further “accent-uating” this island’s many charms.  Perhaps it’s because of this English influence that the island prides itself on treating everyone with respect and courtesy, but that attitude extends towards its beautifully-kept lands. All the beaches are well-cared-for, public, and free of cost to enjoy. Locals love the northern and western shores, but every compass direction boasts uncrowded stretches of sand seemingly made just for you.",

Urban Condado in Santurce, east of the historic city center, is where you’ll find the most vibrant gay scene as well as discos, casinos, and incredible resorts…but its beaches are where you’ll find the tropical escape you came for.   Attractions are far from restricted to those catering exclusively to the LGBT community, however. Cross Dos Hermanos Bridge from this elite “new” San Juan to stride along the blue cobblestone, 16th century forts, and European architecture of Old San Juan. Head over to Ocean Park to swim and surf by wave or by kite—among other beaches. It’s this combination of seaside life, urban pizzazz, colonial charm, and freedom to simply be that has made this destination one that so many have fallen in love with.",

The wildlife on land is just as diverse as that in the sea. Mongooses, frigate birds, cattle egrets, and actual cattle—along with goats, black-bellied sheep, and vervet monkeys—roam this rare American oceanic rainforest, more than a quarter of which has been designated as a national park.

Under the shadow of its magnificent World Heritage-listed Pitons—the island’s two signature peaks—is a litany of things to do. More than 23 scuba sites of note lay waiting to be plumbed, and on land, biking and zipline excursions take you through the jungle. Just as diverse as the wildlife found there is the culture you’ll find in its towns. There, jazz and calypso spice up the sound of its streets while Asian, American, European, and Caribbean flavors do the same to its cuisine.  In its capital, Castries, be sure to explore the street market and weekend fish fries; in Soufriere, Sulphur Springs’ mud baths may just cure what ails you. It’s one of the world’s only drive-in volcanoes, and one of the island’s biggest attractions. Cruisers tend to stick to the capital, but with time on your side with a land stay, Marigot Bay and Gros Islet have a chance to compete against your resort’s shores to become your favorite beach in the Caribbean.",

The Corridor enthralls with 20 miles of upscale resorts, gated communities, impressive spas, championship golf courses, and remarkable beaches ideal for water sports. On the other side is Cabo San Lucas, whose trendy restaurants and bars—including Sammy Hagar of Van Halen’s Cabo Wabo Cantina—and slick Luxury Avenue mall provide divertissements aplenty. It’s here that you’ll find Rainbow Bar, the most famous gay bar in the region, and Chandelier’s, the self-proclaimed “official gay bar of Los Cabos.” Dance clubs like Passion, Pink Kitty, and Mandala keep you on your feet; same with the DJs at Closet.

It’s just one of the many events that have made this destination perfectly fine with passing the title of America’s gaming capital to its glitzy neighbor Las Vegas. Far from one-note, the city has become better known for its adventuresome options in the great outdoors, from the banks of the Truckee River to the snow-capped peaks of the Sierra Nevada.   After a long day of hiking, biking, whitewater rafting, kayaking, skiing, or scrambling up—or down!—challenging rock faces, treat yourself to a bite at one of the many restaurants on the River Walk and Cal Ave downtown. But first, grab a drink at any of the lounges with a rooftop deck; you should be able to enjoy a prime view of the famous town arch as you watch the sun go down. Art galleries and locally owned retail shops provide more treats for the eyes, but your ears will thank you if you’re lucky enough to catch a performance of the Nevada Gay Men’s Chorus. If not, there’s always the Vegas-style clubs, the Old West honky-tonks and saloons, and, of course, the tuneful warbling of the slot machines in the casinos that first made Reno famous.",

The East Village: artsy, trendy, hipster, and perennially alternative. Park Slope and Williamsburg, Brooklyn and Hell’s Kitchen: the new kids and rising stars. With so many neighborhoods vying for the top spot as the “gayborhood,” plus challengers from the boroughs, the competition is fierce and much to your advantage.   Get a taste for them all with help from the well-connected subway network between iconic experiences. Gawp at the Statue of Liberty or the flashing screens surrounding Times Square; take in a Broadway musical in the nearby Theater District; and shop on Fifth Avenue or Canal Street. Be prepared to make tough decisions, like which of the nearly 2,084 restaurants—126 of them Michelin-starred—you want to have dinner in, or where you’ll have the best slice of pizza in your life. And even with a hotel picked out, where to spend the night in the City That Never Sleeps is another hard choice, with literally countless gay bars, lounges, and nightclubs to lure you from your pillow. Good thing then that this city runs on the electric energy of its people—see if you can use that excitement to recharge your batteries!  After all, you’ll want to make the most of every moment in this dynamic, fast-paced destination. The list of things to do, see, and taste are simply inexhaustible. MoMA, the Guggenheim, the Met, and the Museum of Natural History are classics for the cultured; for the curious, the Museum of Sex, Tenement Museum, and the one at the South Street Seaport intrigue. Central Park, the High Line, and a long list of botanical gardens from Manhattan to Brooklyn to Queens make spring in the city even more delightful, while the charming and car-less Fire Island draw the LGBT crowd out to Long Island every summer. The list goes on and on, but we won’t …because when your destination is New York City, you don’t have a minute to waste.",
